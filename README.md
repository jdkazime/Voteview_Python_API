# Voteview_Python_API
A simple exploration into the data found under https://voteview.com/data.  We focus on generating adjacency matrices and the subsequent visualization.

One must download the "HSall_votes" CSV and place it in the /voteview_data folder, as the file is too large to be hosted via Github.  They can be found at the aforementioned link. 
Particularly, by choosing

Data Type:  Members' Votes

Chamber:  House and Senate

Congress: All

File Format:  CSV

one can get the data needed.  Otherwise, "HSall.csv" is provided.
